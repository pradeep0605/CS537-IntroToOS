This Project is implemented in XV6 kernel. The aim of the project is to provide a means of detection of file corruption.
Checksum is stored for Each of the blocks in the file. While writing to the disk, checksum is calculated and stored in the higher 8-bits
of the pointer. When reading a block, its checksum is calculated again and compared with the stored checksum in the pointer. If the
checksums do not match, then it means that the block has been corrupted. The corroupted blocks are not read to the user buffer; -1 is returned 
to the user application.
